        <description><p1>Blog as A Collection of Times</p1></description>
       <content><p2>This is a blog for me to track the process of exploration into different subjects, including artistic practice, pedagogy, maker’s culture, create-with-care and more. When I’ve been asked to present my work portfolio to friends or potential collaborators, I find a .pdf or website with a nice-layout limited to what I want to convey to the audience. I understand the nature of a work portfolio being a “showcase of your most convincing works”. Yet, I find presenting the process you take to get to that “convincing work” significant and often being under-rated. What if I cannot give “my most convincing works” yet? What if I have evolved since the last time I’ve presented my portfolio to you that I am scared you would not understand the reason behind? Am I a failed artist? </p2><br><br><p2>When I took Fab Academy in 2019, an online/offline training in digital fabrication and project management, Prof. Neil kept on emphasizing the importance of “log-as-you-work”. In the website I made during Fab Academy, I’ve included a repo on every week’s course content, step-to-step tutorial on my weekly projects, images and videos related to the process, fabrication files. When I look back, what intrigues me is that none of the process was perfect from the start. I’ve included the full episode in my working process, including failures and solutions to bugs. Since Fab Academy, I’ve been re-visiting my own and other peer’s work-log “blog” when I need to find an explanation to a problem. In addition, I’ve been told that students from other years would refer to my blog for suggestions when they experience issues. </p2><br><br><p2>For years, I thought blog is going to extinguish. I regained faith in blogging since Fab Academy and began to follow blogs by my favorite artists and writers. Although in today’s world we are over-loaded with information to choose from, I am still willing to make time for people (including those I admire and do not know in person) I resonate with. Many creative technologists utilize platforms such as Medium and Github blog to keep track of their reflections. </p2><br><br><p2>Words in blog is a collection of times. Fab Academy has allowed me to embody this experience to its fullest. Other blog authors that made an impact on me include Clara Lieu (my drawing professor back in RISD, 2015; she keeps track of her recent projects, reflection on teaching and learning, Q and As), Kobakant (a wearable tech collective based in Berlin; they keep track of their projects, work-in-progress and events in a chronological order), Taeyoon Choi (artist and educator, co-founder of School for Poetic Computation based in NYC and Seoul; I find both his website and Medium a work log of his ever-evolving artistic practice that grows in parallel with his everyday experience at his workplace and his geographic location). How they give transparency to their progress and change make me rethink about how the time it takes and the way toward “made-it” is different for everyone. </p2><br><br><p2>At a reading session on George Bastille put together by my friend Xiaofu, we’ve talked about how Bastille is different from Kant. Kant believes education leads to ethical perfection, whereas Bastille embraces an infinite inner experience without a defined end or perfect state that is more absolute than death. I am not sure where I will head toward with a defined answer, but I hope to keep on learning and unlearning with a beginner’s mindset. Looking forward!</p2><br></content>
